# Ansible Community Meeting

The Ansible Community Meeting happens weekly on Wednesdays at 18:00 UTC in
[#community:ansible.com](https://matrix.to/#/#community:ansible.com) (Matrix).

## Ping List

Interested community members can add their Matrix nick to
[meeting-people.txt](https://github.com/ansible-community/meetings/tree/main/meetings/community-wg-meeting/meeting-people.txt)
if they'd like to be pinged when the meeting starts.

The meeting chair can run `./meeting-people.py` to format the list into a ping
message that can be copied into their IRC/Matrix client.
