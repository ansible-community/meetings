# Ansible Meetings, Schedule, and Meeting Logs

[![Discuss on Matrix at #community:ansible.com](https://img.shields.io/matrix/community:ansible.com.svg?server_fqdn=ansible-accounts.ems.host&label=Discuss%20on%20Matrix%20at%20%23community:ansible.com&logo=matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#community:ansible.com)


A GitHub repository for the shared Ansible community Working group meeting calendar

**NOTE - Working group calendars are moving to the [Ansible Forum Events Calendar](https://forum.ansible.com/c/events/8). In the forum, you can select which working groups you want to attend and click the `...` button to add to your personal calendar.**

This repository replaces the meeting logic in https://github.com/ansible/community/tree/main/meetings but is being phased out and replaced by the shared Ansible events calendar in the Ansible forum.


Most Ansible working group meetings are held in [Matrix](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#ansible-community-on-matrix) rooms.

See this list of [official working groups](https://forum.ansible.com/g) or the [events calendar](https://forum.ansible.com/c/events/8) to find the Matrix room or other meeting details.

## Schedule

**NOTE** As we are transitioning away from this calendar, check the [events calendar](https://forum.ansible.com/c/events/8) for additional meetings that have already moved.

You can add the following partial list of meetings to your personal calendar by importing [ansible_community_meetings.ics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible-community/meetings/main/ansible_community_meetings.ics).

> Some calendars, such as Google Calendar, support importing by URL.
> This allows the calendar to update automatically when changes are made.
