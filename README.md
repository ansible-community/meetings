[![Discuss on Matrix at #community:ansible.com](https://img.shields.io/matrix/community:ansible.com.svg?server_fqdn=ansible-accounts.ems.host&label=Discuss%20on%20Matrix%20at%20%23community:ansible.com&logo=matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#community:ansible.com)




** We publish working group calendars in the [Ansible Forum Events Calendar](https://forum.ansible.com/c/events/8). In the forum, you can select which working groups you want to attend and click the `...` button to add to your personal calendar.**

The forum replaces the meeting logic in https://github.com/ansible/community/tree/main/meetings/

Most Ansible working group meetings are held in [Matrix](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#ansible-community-on-matrix) rooms.

See this list of [official working groups](https://forum.ansible.com/g) or the [events calendar](https://forum.ansible.com/c/events/8) to find the Matrix room or other meeting details.

## Meeting Minutes

See [Meeting summaries and logs](https://forum.ansible.com/c/workflow/meetbot/16) for the results of each meeting.

Invite @ansibot:ansible.im to your Matrix channel to autogenerate meeting summaries and logs that are automatically
posted to the forum at the link above.
